An e-commerce site for musical instruments.

Basic guide to collaborating on Github:

  1. Open Visual Studio and install GitHub Extention for Visual Studio (Tools>Extentions and Updates>Online> search for github).
  2. Once installed, open Team Explorer and login to GitHub.
  3. Clone the project.
  4. Open the solution file to start working on the project.
  5. Using Team Explorer, create a New Branch to commit your changes to.  Commit changes and push to github.
  6. On Github, submit a Pull Request with your branch.
  7. Resolve any conflict, commit those changes to the Pull Request, then merge the Pull Request to the master branch.

I (Jonathan) am new to collaborating on GitHub.  If you know a better way to handle this, please let me know.
